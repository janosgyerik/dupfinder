### usability

- Apply filters to directories too. For example do not descend into `.git`
- Add `-lazy` to check only first 10% and last 10%
- Add `-trees` option to find duplicate trees

### polishing

- get the pools more directly in `dupTracker.getDupGroups`, without the ugly delete
- Eliminate code duplication in test of library and test of main
- maximum reasonable test coverage
- document public types and functions
- post on code review
- post on blog
